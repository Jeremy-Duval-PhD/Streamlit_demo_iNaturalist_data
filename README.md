# Project : Streamlit_demo_iNaturalist_data
This is a Streamlit app demo using data from iNaturalist to help with data visualization and explore the question of how years impact the spatial distribution of species.

## Application goal
This application was developed with two specific goals in mind:
1. to demonstrate the possibilities of Python development with the Streamlit API
2. to enable naturalists to observe species movements over time using a simple data visualization tool 

## Streamlit in two words
Let them speak for themselves:
> Streamlit is an open-source Python framework for data scientists and AI/ML engineers to deliver dynamic data apps with only a few lines of code.

## What is iNaturalist ?
> iNaturalist is an online social network of people sharing biodiversity information to help each other learn about nature

On iNaturalist, people can record their own observations, discuss them, and receive help with identification.
It should be noted that this is a non-profit organization.
